This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


Task 1
```{r}
sum(5:55)
```


Task 2
```{r}
# The function sumfun calculates the sum of all integers between 5 and n
sumfun <- function(n) sum(5:n)
sumfun(10)
sumfun(20)
sumfun(100)
```


Task 3
```{r}
# The function fib(n) will print the first n elements of the Fibonacci sequence
fib <- function(n) {
  x = 0
  y = 1
  v <- c()
  if (n < 1) {
    sprintf("There is no Fibonacci sequence with %i elements.  Please enter a positive integer.", n)
    } else {
    if (n == 1) {
      v[[1]] <- 1
      } else {
        v[[1]] <- 1
        for (i in 2:n) {
          z = x + y
          v[[i]] <- z
          x = y
          y = z
        }
      }
      print(v)
    }
}
fib(12)
```


Task 4
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
#ggplot(data=mtcars, aes(x=as.factor(mpg), fill = factor(gear))) + geom_bar()

ggplot(mtcars) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = mpg, fill = factor(gear)), bins = 25)
```


Task 5
```{r}
str(cars)
y <- cars$speed; x <- cars$dist;
model <- lm(formula="y~x")
model
summary(model)
```
the fitted slope x = 0.16557 with standard error 0.87438
the intercept b = 8.28391 with standard error 0.01749


Task 6
```{r}
ggplot(cars,aes(speed, dist)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula=y~x)
```


Task 7a
Total distance tD = reaction distance (rD) + breaking distance (bD)
If bD is proportional to speed (sp) squared we can say bD = beta(sp^2)
So tD = rD + beta(sp^2)
So a regression of tD (y) ~ sp^2 (x)

```{r}
y <- cars$dist; x <- cars$speed*cars$speed;
model_2 <- lm(formula="y~x")
model_2
summary(model_2)
```
The intercept 8.86005 gives an estimate of the reaction distance.
Assuming that distance is given in metres and speed is given in metres per second, 
  reaction time (rT)  = rD / sp seconds
                      = 8.86005 / sp

Task 7b
```{r}
ggplot(cars,aes(speed^2, dist)) + geom_point() +
geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x)
```

The data looks good and there is a clear linear relationship between the square of the speed and the dist

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
